# Lazy Kaggler
## A Python wrapper for the Kaggle API

* Designed for Kaggle enthusiasts who enjoy working and prototyping using their own IDEs, but (like me) are too lazy to type a bunch of command lines to directly use the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) :)
  * ... make sure you set up your Kaggle API token as instructed [here!](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials)
* Still a work in progress, but it's not bad so far!
